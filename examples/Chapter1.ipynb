    "# Chain Complexes\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kenzo program, a *chain complex* $(C_p, d_p)$ is a collection of free $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules $(C_p)$, one for each\n",
    "$p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, together with a homomorphism $d_p : C_p \\rightarrow C_{p-1}$, such\n",
    "that, for all $p$, $d_{p-1} \\circ d_p = 0$. (See, for example, __P.J. Giblin__ in *Graph, Surface and Homology*, Chapman and Hall Math. series, 1981.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kenzo program, a *morphism* $f=(f_p)$, of degree $k$, from a chain complex $(C_p, d_p)$ to another $(C'_p, d'_p)$ is a collection of homomorphisms\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_p : C_p \\rightarrow C'_{p+k}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is expressed by the following diagram, generally not assumend commutative .\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\cdots & \\leftarrow & C_{p-1} & \\quad\\xleftarrow{d_p} & C_p & \\quad\\xleftarrow{d_{p+1}} & C_{p+1}  & \\quad\\leftarrow & \\cdots \\\\\n",

    "Three types of   morphisms are most generally considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $k=0$. If the commutativity relation $d'_p\\circ f_p=f_{p-1}\\circ d_p$ holds for every $p$, then the morphism $f$ is an ordinary chain complex morphism or *chain map*.\n",
    "2. $k=-1$. If $(C_p,d_p)=(C'_p,d'_p)$ and $f_p=d_p$, then $f$ is the *differential* of the chain complex $(C_p,d_p)$ and, in fact, this differential is implemented in the ${\\tt Kenzo}$ program as a morphism of degree $-1$. Also, if $d_p \\neq f_p$ and $(d_{p-1}+f_{p-1})(d_p+f_p) = 0$ for every $p$, then $f_\\ast$ is a perturbation of the differential $d_\\ast$.\n",
    "3. $k=+1$. In this case, $f$ is usually a *homotopy operator*, that is, some relation $$d'_{p+1}\\circ f_p+f_{p-1}\\circ d_p=g_p-g'_p$$ is satisfied for two (ordinary) chain complex morphisms $g_\\ast$ and $g'_\\ast$, and $f_\\ast$ is a homotopy between $g_\\ast$ and $g'_\\ast$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For technical reasons, these three types of morphisms have been implemented in the `Kenzo` program\n",
    "in a unique type.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Generators, terms, and combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "To become familiar with the Lisp functions implementing the chain complexes, the best is to begin with an example. *Simplicial complexes* are good candidates for this purpose, and we shall take as a typical example the following simplicial complex."

It is very important to note that the generators to be compared are assumed to be of the *same degree*, i.e. they must belong to the same group $C_p$. As an exception with the general policy of the program, this degree is not explicitly precised. The implementor has chosen to avoid additional tests because in real problems the program spends a lot of time comparing generators.\n",
    "2. `basis`, a lisp function giving the distinguished **ordered** basis of the free $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules ($C_p$). (Recall that in the program, only free chain complexes are considered.) When some  components of the chain complex are not finitely generated, we say that the chain complex is *locally effective*. In this case the value of this slot must be the keyword `locally-effective`.\n",

The real connection between the  arguments `intr-dffr` and `strt`will be detailed hereafter through typical examples. The general idea is the following: if the strategy is `:gnrt`, the `:intr-dffr` argument function  uses two arguments, namely a degree and a generator of this degree and computes the boundary combination of this generator. If the strategy is `:cmbn`, the `:intr-dffr` argument function uses a combination as argument and computes the boundary combination of this argument. We recall that a combination contains its own degree.\n",

If, during a Lisp session, the user wishes to  modify any slot of an existing chain complex, by calling again `build-chcm`, he must change also the comment, otherwise the new version of the object will not be created. This remark is valid for any kind of instantiation of `Kenzo` objects.

The reverse action is taken if $p$ is odd. So, from the programming point of view, it is sufficient to test the parity of $p+k$.\n",
