    "## Coalgebras\n",
    "\n",
    "A coalgebra  is a pair $(C, \\chi)$ where\n",

    "\n",
    "A coalgebra is represented as an instance of the CLOS class ``COALGEBRA``, subclass of the ``CHAIN COMPLEX`` class. The definition of this new class is simply:\n",

    "So, this new class inherits the slots of the ``CHAIN COMPLEX`` class and has a slot of its own, namely ``cprd``, a morphism  object representing the coproduct. The user will note the important following fact that, **once a coalgebra has been defined, one may use on it any\n",

    "\n",
    "So, let ${\\cal A}$ be  a coalgebra , assumed 1-connected, i.e. ${\\cal A}_1 = 0$ and  ${\\cal A}_0 \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}$, we consider the chain complex, $Cobar^{{\\cal A}}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$, noted more simply  $Cobar({\\cal A})$, whose $n$-th component is:\n",

    "A tensor product $g_1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes g_k$, where $g_i$ is a generator of ${\\bar{\\cal A}}_{i}$ is called, in the software ``Kenzo``, an **algebraic loop**. The reason is the following: if $X$ is a 1-connected simplicial set, we shall see in a next chapter that the program ``Kenzo`` constructs a homotopy equivalence between the chain complex of the loop space ${\\cal C}_*(GX)$ and $Cobar({\\cal C}_*(X)) = Cobar^{{\\cal C}_*(X)}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$, so that a generator of the last chain complex is a kind of \"algebraic\" version of a generator of a loop space.

In other words, $\\Delta_2^\\mathbb{N}$ is 1-reduced: 1 vertex, no edges.\n",

In dimension 0, for every non-negative $m$ and $n$, the vertices ``(m)`` and ``(n)`` are identified; in dimension 1, the list $(m\\, n)$ is always an *illegal* 1-simplex. This coalgebra will be located through the symbol ``smp-deltab2``. The lisp definition uses the function ``build-smst`` that will be described in the simplicial set chapter. For the moment, it is sufficient to know, that the function ``build-smst`` allows us to create a coalgebra suitable for the tests. The definition  of $\\Delta_2^\\mathbb{N}$ given here, is only for pedagogical purpose, an efficient definition using another representation for the simplices is provided in the software ``Kenzo``."
