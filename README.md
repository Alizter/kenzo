# Welcome to Kenzo

*!!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!*

This is a repackaged version of the Kenzo program by Francis Sergeraert
and Xavier Dousson. The original version of the program can be found
at http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/ .

This version aims to update its infrastructure by providing the following:

1. Installation via the [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) library
   manager
2. A simple regression test suite based on
   [FiveAM](http://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/)
   (Based on tests scattered throughout the source code in comments.)
3. Support for [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/)
